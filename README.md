# DataArgumenter
**new method of data argumenting using linear algebra**

Any square matrix can _uniquely_ be written as sum of a _symmetric_ and a _skew-symmetric_ matrix. This decomposition is known as the *Toeplitz decomposition*. Let <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Mat_n"> denote the space of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n*n">  matrices. If <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Sym_n"> denotes the space of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n*n"> symmetric matrices and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Skew_n"> the space of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n*n"> skew-symmetric matrices then <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Mat_n={Skew_n}+{Sym_n}">

Forexample consider this example:
I turned right image into two unique and equlivent images on the left

with this method we can easily double our dataset so it may helps our learning algorithm converge or generalize on new data better.But the problem is using this method will make our learning objective more difficult  therefore the learning may be  less accurate. thus I tried to check its efficiency and compare it with the same network architecture. the result is amazing!  

**check my work now.**
